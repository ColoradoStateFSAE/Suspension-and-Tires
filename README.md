Feel free to email me with any questions 
This is a repository for tire modelling and suspension code. Currently, 
all I have is a combined slip tire model as well as some ride and roll 
rate stuff. The tire model works off of tire normal force FZ, camber angle
IA, slip angle SA and slip ratio SR. It's based off empirical data and 
thus does not model tire behavior under non testing conditions.
